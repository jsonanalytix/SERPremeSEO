## PRD: Plastic Surgery Web Design Landing Page (Google Ads Lead Gen)

**Client / Brand:** SERPreme SEO
**Build tool:** Cursor
**Traffic source:** Google Ads (Search)
**Primary conversions:** (1) Lead form submissions, (2) Phone calls (tap-to-call + tracked calls)

### 0) Reference + “Mimic Exactly” Requirement

This new landing page must strongly mimic the existing *Healthcare Website Design* service page in:

* Visual design system (colors, typography, spacing, button styles, icon style)
* Layout patterns + section rhythm
* CTA placement and overall page architecture

Reference pattern page (do not change its global branding; clone its patterns):

```txt
https://serpremeseo.com/services/healthcare-web-design/
```

(Use it as the “template” for layout, UI components, and content flow.) ([Serpreme SEO][1])

---

## 1) Problem Statement

Plastic surgeons are in an ultra-competitive, high-trust, high-ticket category. Many practice websites fail to:

* Convert paid traffic into consult requests
* Build trust fast enough (credentials, outcomes, social proof)
* Handle photo-heavy content without becoming slow (especially galleries)
* Protect patient privacy and avoid risky data handling (especially around photos/forms)

This landing page exists to turn “plastic surgery web design” intent into calls + qualified leads with minimal friction, while positioning SERPreme as the specialist option (not a generic agency). ([Serpreme SEO][1])

---

## 2) Goals, Success Metrics, Non‑Goals

### Goals

1. **Maximize conversions from paid search**: calls + lead forms.
2. **Increase lead quality**: attract legitimate plastic surgery practices (owners, practice managers).
3. **Differentiate SERPreme** vs generic web designers/agencies: healthcare-grade UX + privacy-conscious infrastructure + SEO/paid conversion focus. ([Serpreme SEO][1])

### Primary Success Metrics (KPIs)

* **Form conversion rate** (sessions → form submit)
* **Call conversion rate** (sessions → call click / tracked call)
* **Qualified lead rate** (% leads that are real plastic surgery practices)
* **Cost per lead** (from ads platform)

### Secondary Metrics

* Time to first CTA interaction
* Scroll depth to Packages / FAQ
* Bounce rate on paid traffic
* Page speed / Core Web Vitals (must be “good”) ([Google for Developers][2])

### Non‑Goals

* Ranking this page for broad, unrelated terms (e.g., “med spa web design”).
* Being a general “healthcare web design” page. This is strictly for plastic surgeons.

---

## 3) Target Audience + Intent

### Target roles

* Practice Owner / Surgeon
* Practice Manager / Administrator
* Marketing manager for a plastic surgery practice

### Search intent (Google Ads)

High commercial intent queries like:

* “plastic surgery web design”
* “plastic surgeon website design”
* “cosmetic surgery web designer”
* “plastic surgery website agency”

**Key intent signal:** They want a site that *looks premium* and *produces consult requests*, not “a pretty brochure.”

---

## 4) Positioning & Key Messages

### Value prop (above the fold)

**“Plastic surgery web design built to generate consults.”**
Not generic web design. Conversion-first UX, SEO-ready structure, and privacy-conscious implementation.

### Differentiators to emphasize (SERPreme vs others)

Mirror the “SERPreme Difference” comparison format from the reference page. ([Serpreme SEO][1])
Add plastic-surgery-specific emphasis:

* **Photo-heavy performance** (before/after galleries that load fast)
* **Trust architecture** (credentials, safety, outcomes, reviews)
* **Privacy & risk reduction** for forms and patient images

Why these matter:

* Plastic surgery relies heavily on photography; standards and secure handling matter. ([PMC][3])
* Patients often use online reviews as “social proof” when choosing a plastic surgeon, so trust elements and reputation support matter. ([American Society of Plastic Surgeons][4])

---

## 5) Compliance & Risk Requirements (HIPAA + Privacy Copy)

### Important framing (for copy + UX)

* **Do not collect PHI in the SERPreme lead form.** This form is for *practice inquiries only*.
* Include explicit “don’t submit patient info” microcopy near every form.

Why: HIPAA governs use/disclosure of protected health information by covered entities and business associates. ([HHS.gov][5])
Also, patient photos can constitute PHI and require secure storage/handling. ([PMC][3])

### Required HIPAA-related copy blocks (to include on-page)

You must include **both**:

1. **Service capability copy** (SERPreme sets up HIPAA-conscious infrastructure) — adapt from reference page’s HIPAA section. ([Serpreme SEO][1])
2. **Form disclaimer copy** (practice inquiry only; no PHI)

**Form disclaimer (place directly under submit button):**

> *Practice inquiries only. Please do not submit patient names, photos, medical details, or any protected health information (PHI) through this form.*

**Additional footer disclaimer (small text near final CTA / FAQ):**

> *This page is for plastic surgery practices exploring web design services. Not for patient scheduling or medical communication.*

### Accessibility compliance note (avoid “magic plugin” claims)

The reference page explicitly calls out that accessibility can’t be solved by automated widgets alone and mentions enforcement action against a vendor for misleading WCAG compliance claims. Keep that positioning (adapt wording; don’t overpromise). ([Federal Trade Commission][6])

---

## 6) UX Strategy (Conversion First)

### Principles

* **Fast trust** in < 5 seconds: specialty + outcomes + credibility + simple next step
* **Two primary CTAs everywhere:** Call + Form
* **Minimal friction:** short form, visible phone, sticky CTA patterns, clear expectations

### Required conversion mechanics

1. **Sticky header CTA (desktop + mobile)**

   * Right side: phone number with “Call Now”
   * Primary button: “Request a Consultation” (scrolls to hero form or opens modal)
   * Mimic existing header style and “CALL NOW / BOOK NOW” vibe, but optimize for PPC. ([Serpreme SEO][1])

2. **Hero section: add an in-hero lead form**

   * Keep the same left-copy / right-visual rhythm as reference, but swap the right visual to a **form card** (or form card + small device mock).
   * This is the #1 conversion lever for paid search.

3. **Mobile sticky bottom bar**

   * Left: tap-to-call
   * Right: “Get Quote” (scroll to form)

4. **Short form (frictionless)**

   * Required fields: Name, Practice Name, Email, Phone
   * Optional fields: Website URL, “What do you need?” dropdown
   * Add “response time” microcopy (e.g., “Reply within 1 business day”)

5. **Trust markers near form**

   * “HIPAA-conscious infrastructure”
   * “Conversion-focused UX”
   * “Healthcare-specialist team”
     (Keep icons consistent with the reference page.)

### Content scannability requirements

Follow scannability best practices: descriptive headings, short paragraphs, bulleted lists. ([YaleSites][7])
This is doubly important for stressed, busy practice owners skimming between consults.

---

## 7) Page Information Architecture (Mirror the Reference Page)

**Rule:** Keep the same *section order* and *component patterns* as the Healthcare Web Design page, updating copy to plastic surgery specifics. ([Serpreme SEO][1])

### Section-by-section structure (with requirements)

#### A) Hero (Above the fold)

**H1:** Plastic Surgery Web Design That Drives Consult Requests
**H2:** Your website isn’t just a gallery. It’s your consult engine.
**Body (1 short paragraph):** Emphasize premium trust + conversion + speed + SEO-ready.

**CTAs:**

* Primary: “Get A Quote” (scroll to form)
* Secondary: “View Our Portfolio” (opens portfolio page in same tab or new—your choice based on current site behavior)

**Hero form card (right column):**

* Title: “Get a Quote for Your Practice”
* Fields + HIPAA form disclaimer + privacy reassurance

> Must visually match the SERPreme card/button styles and spacing from the reference page. ([Serpreme SEO][1])

#### B) Problem/Solution Intro (the “WE FIX THAT BY…” section)

Keep the same structure:

* Headline about elevating patient trust + converting visitors into consults
* Short paragraph calling out outdated/slow/confusing/non-compliant sites
* “WE FIX THAT BY…” bullets — adapt to plastic surgery

Add at least one bullet about:
**Before/after gallery UX + performance + privacy-conscious handling** (because photography is core in this specialty). ([PMC][3])

#### C) “Why Your Plastic Surgery Website Matters More Than Ever”

Mirror the checklist style from reference:

* Fast
* Mobile-first
* Privacy-conscious
* Easy to navigate
* ADA-maintained
* SEO-optimized
* Built around real patient journeys (consult funnel)

Keep the same tone (“This isn’t optional…”). ([Serpreme SEO][1])

#### D) Pain Points (Q&A style)

Clone the “We Hear the Pain Points…” pattern and rewrite for plastic surgeons.

**Required pain points to include (minimum 5):**

1. “My website looks outdated and doesn’t match the premium brand I’m building.”
2. “My before-and-after gallery is slow / messy, and I worry about consent and privacy.”

   * Tie to the fact that clinical photos are sensitive and require secure handling. ([PMC][3])
3. “I’m paying for ads but the site doesn’t convert to consult requests.”
4. “Prospects can’t quickly find procedures, pricing context/financing, or how to book.”
5. “I can’t maintain the site myself.”

Optional (strongly recommended):

* “Reviews are all over the place and I can’t control the narrative.”

  * Patients often use online reviews as a decision factor, but reviews can be polarized. ([American Society of Plastic Surgeons][4])

#### E) “What’s Included” + Metrics band

Maintain the same pattern, but adapt the metric labels:

* “Increase in Consult Request Form Fills and Phone Calls”
* “Increase in Calls from Google Business Profile”
* “Increase in Website Visits”

(Keep the exact visual layout.) ([Serpreme SEO][1])

#### F) “The SERPreme Difference” comparison block

Replicate the side-by-side “SERPreme vs Other Agencies” component style.

**Required rows (keep structure + icons):**

1. ADA-Friendly Design (manual, standards-based; no “set it and forget it”) ([Federal Trade Commission][6])
2. HIPAA-Conscious Infrastructure (hosting/email/forms/booking) ([Serpreme SEO][1])
3. Custom Plastic Surgery Website Design (premium branding + trust)
4. Consult Conversion Architecture (procedure pages → proof → CTA → booking)
5. SEO-Optimized Procedure Content (E‑E‑A‑T style)
6. Fast, Image-Optimized Development (gallery performance)

**Note:** Avoid claiming a widget guarantees WCAG compliance; keep the FTC reference logic consistent with the reference page. ([Federal Trade Commission][6])

#### G) Feature deep-dives (anchor list + sections)

Keep the anchor nav list format (the inline list of features) and the repeated image + text section pattern. ([Serpreme SEO][1])

Required feature sections (rewrite titles to plastic surgery while staying structurally similar):

* Custom Plastic Surgery Website Design
* HIPAA-Conscious Infrastructure (Hosting, Email, Booking, Forms)
* Patient Journey Site Architecture (procedure-first IA)
* SEO-Optimized Procedure Content
* Fast, Mobile-Optimized Development (Core Web Vitals targets)
* Secure Online Consultation Booking
* ADA-Friendly Design
* Provider Directory + Location Tools (for multi-surgeon practices)
* Ongoing Support, Optimization & Maintenance

Performance thresholds to mention internally (in dev acceptance):

* LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1 ([Google for Developers][2])

#### H) Website Packages

Keep the same package cards and pricing structure unless SERPreme wants different pricing.

* Starter ($2,000)
* Compete ($8,000)
* Conquer ($14,000)

Update bullet text to reflect plastic surgery specifics, but keep:

* HIPAA setup
* ADA-friendly
* content writing words/page
* email deliverability
* support duration ([Serpreme SEO][1])

#### I) FAQ

Clone the FAQ questions and rewrite where needed for plastic surgery. Keep at least these:

* Cost
* Timeline (template vs custom)
* Blog option
* Post-launch support ([Serpreme SEO][1])

Add 1–2 plastic-surgery-specific FAQs:

* “Can you build fast before-and-after galleries without compromising privacy?”
* “Can you structure procedure pages for SEO and consult conversions?”

#### J) Final CTA section

Keep same strong close:

* Headline: “Request an Initial Consultation”
* Restate outcomes: premium design + consult conversion + privacy-conscious systems
* Button and phone CTA

---

## 8) SEO + Message Match Requirements

### On-page SEO

* URL slug: `/services/plastic-surgery-web-design/` (or matching existing routing conventions)
* Title tag includes “Plastic Surgery Web Design”
* H1 exactly includes primary keyword
* Meta description includes: consults + performance + privacy-conscious + SERPreme

### Internal linking

* Link to portfolio
* Link to contact/consultation
* Link to relevant healthcare web design parent page (if appropriate)

### Schema

* Service schema
* FAQPage schema (matching FAQ section)

---

## 9) Tracking, Analytics, and Call Attribution

### Required events

* `lead_form_submit`
* `phone_click`
* `calendly_click` (if booking remains)
* `package_cta_click`
* `faq_expand`

### Required integrations

* GA4: Google Analytics 4
* GTM: Google Tag Manager
* Call tracking vendor (if used): CallRail (or existing equivalent)

**Call tracking requirement:** dynamic number insertion for paid traffic (to attribute calls to ads/keywords).

---

## 10) Visual/UI Design Requirements (Exact SERPreme Branding)

**Non-negotiable:** Do not invent a new style. Reuse:

* Existing fonts
* Existing color tokens / CSS variables
* Existing button components
* Existing section spacing, container widths, grid system
* Existing icon style

This is how you guarantee it “feels identical” to the Healthcare Web Design page. ([Serpreme SEO][1])

---

# Cursor Build Instructions (Implementation Plan)

Below is the exact step-by-step workflow to follow inside Cursor so it can build this page *using the existing Healthcare Web Design page as the base*.

## Step 1 — Create the page by cloning the reference implementation

1. **Create a new branch**

   * `feature/plastic-surgery-web-design-landing`

2. **Locate the source of the Healthcare Web Design page**

   * In Cursor search (project-wide), search for one of these exact strings:

     * `Strategic Healthcare Web Design That Drives Patient Engagement`
     * `WE FIX THAT BY...`
     * `HIPAA-Compliant Infrastructure (Hosting, Email, Booking, Forms)`
   * Identify the page file / template / route that renders it. ([Serpreme SEO][1])

3. **Duplicate the page**

   * Copy the entire page implementation and create a new route/slug:

     * `plastic-surgery-web-design`
   * Keep all shared layout wrappers, components, and styling classes identical.

**Acceptance check:** If you swap only the words “Healthcare” → “Plastic Surgery” and it still looks like the same page, you’re in the right file.

---

## Step 2 — Replace copy with the plastic surgery version (don’t touch styling)

1. Create a dedicated copy source file so the page isn’t one giant text blob:

   * Example: `plasticSurgeryWebDesign.copy.ts` (or `.json`, matching the codebase style)
2. Paste the section-by-section copy from the “Copy Deck” below.
3. Wire the page to read from that copy object.

**Acceptance check:** No CSS changes required. No new fonts. No new colors.

---

## Step 3 — Add conversion upgrades for Google Ads (form + sticky CTAs)

The reference page is a service page; this new page must behave like a PPC landing page while still matching the same design.

### A) Add hero form card

* Add a right-column card containing the lead form (fields defined above).
* Keep button and input styling consistent with existing form styles (search for existing contact form components in the repo).

**Form fields**

* name (required)
* practice_name (required)
* email (required)
* phone (required)
* website (optional)
* need (dropdown optional)

**Form microcopy (required)**

* Add the HIPAA/PHI disclaimer directly under the submit button (exact text from PRD).

### B) Sticky header CTA

* Add a sticky header state (if not already present)
* Must include:

  * “Call Now” (tel link)
  * “Request a Consultation” (scroll to form section)

### C) Mobile sticky bottom bar

* Add a sticky bottom CTA on mobile only:

  * Left: Call
  * Right: Get Quote (scroll to form)

**Acceptance check:** On mobile, user can call or submit form without hunting.

---

## Step 4 — HIPAA-related copy placement (required)

1. Keep the full HIPAA infrastructure section (adapted wording) in the feature deep-dives. ([Serpreme SEO][1])
2. Add form disclaimer (PHI warning) near every form instance.
3. If there’s a privacy policy link component already used site-wide, include it under the form.

**Acceptance check:** No part of the lead funnel encourages submitting patient data.

---

## Step 5 — Performance requirements (especially image/gallery)

Even if you don’t add a gallery on this landing page, treat it like a photo-heavy category:

* Use responsive images (`srcset` if applicable)
* Compress and lazy-load non-hero images
* Avoid layout shift (reserve image dimensions)
* Target Core Web Vitals “good” thresholds (LCP/INP/CLS). ([Google for Developers][2])

---

## Step 6 — Tracking & conversions

1. Implement event tracking hooks for:

   * form submit success
   * phone click
   * consultation button click
2. Ensure events are available to GA4 + GTM.

**Acceptance check:** Marketing can measure calls vs forms per campaign.

---

## Step 7 — QA checklist (must pass before launch)

* Responsive: mobile/tablet/desktop
* Tap targets: phone CTA is easy on mobile
* Form validation works; confirmation state works
* No new styling regressions on shared components
* Lighthouse: no major CLS issues; decent LCP
* Accessibility basics: heading hierarchy, contrast, alt text

  * Avoid “we’re WCAG compliant because widget” type claims, consistent with FTC guidance. ([Federal Trade Commission][6])

---

# Copy Deck (Paste into the new page)

Below is ready-to-implement copy designed to match the reference page’s tone and structure, but strictly for plastic surgeons.

### HERO

**H1:** Plastic Surgery Web Design That Drives Consult Requests
**H2:** Your website isn’t just a gallery.
**Subhead:** It’s your first impression, your trust builder, and often the deciding factor in whether a prospective patient books with you or a competitor. We design plastic surgery websites that don’t just look premium — they convert. ([Serpreme SEO][1])
**Primary CTA:** Get A Quote
**Secondary CTA:** View Our Portfolio
**Form Title:** Get a Quote for Your Practice
**Form microcopy:** Reply within 1 business day. No obligation.
**PHI disclaimer:** Practice inquiries only. Please do not submit patient names, photos, medical details, or any protected health information (PHI) through this form.

---

### SECTION: “Built to elevate patient trust…”

**Headline:** Plastic surgery website design built to elevate patient trust
**Subheadline:** And turn site visitors into booked consults.
**Body:** Most plastic surgery websites are outdated, slow, confusing, and built like brochures — not conversion engines. In a category where trust and outcomes matter, your site has to do more than “look nice.” ([Serpreme SEO][1])

**WE FIX THAT BY…**

* Building Mobile, Desktop & Tablet Responsive Websites
* Implementing ADA-conscious standards
* Lead-generating design & consult conversion funneling
* SEO-friendly from the start (not as an upcharged add-on)
* Photo-heavy performance (fast before/after UX without the bloat) ([Google for Developers][2])

---

### SECTION: “Why Your Plastic Surgery Website Matters…”

**Intro:** Prospective patients don’t “check out your practice.” They Google you. They skim. They decide fast. ([Serpreme SEO][1])
**Checklist:** A high-performing plastic surgery website must be:

* Fast
* Mobile-first
* Privacy-conscious
* Easy to navigate
* ADA updated & maintained
* Optimized for search engines
* Built around real patient journeys (procedure → proof → consult)

**Closer:** If your site loads slowly, looks outdated, or makes it hard to book, they bounce — usually to a competitor. ([Google for Developers][2])

---

### SECTION: Pain Points (Q&A)

Keep the same quote + response style as the reference page. ([Serpreme SEO][1])

1. **“My website looks outdated and doesn’t reflect a premium practice.”**
   We build modern, conversion-first designs that feel elevated, clean, and medically credible — without looking generic.

2. **“My before-and-after gallery is slow, messy, and I worry about consent and privacy.”**
   Plastic surgery photography is sensitive. We design gallery UX that loads fast and helps you present results professionally, while guiding secure handling practices because clinical photos can be PHI. ([PMC][3])

3. **“I’m paying for ads but the website doesn’t convert to consult requests.”**
   We design pages around conversion paths: trust markers, clear procedure navigation, and frictionless CTAs — built to turn paid clicks into booked consults.

4. **“Prospects can’t find procedures, FAQs, or how to book.”**
   We build scannable layouts, clear IA, and intuitive navigation so people find what they need in seconds. ([YaleSites][7])

5. **“I can’t maintain the site myself.”**
   We build on clean CMS foundations so updates are easy — no developer dependency for basic edits.

(Optional)
6) **“Reviews are a mess and I can’t control the narrative.”**
Patients often rely on online reviews as social proof, but review ecosystems can be biased and polarized — we help you build a website that reinforces trust regardless of platform noise. ([American Society of Plastic Surgeons][4])

---

### SECTION: SERPreme Difference (rows)

Use the same row structure as reference; rewrite the “SERPreme” side to plastic surgery context.

* ADA-Friendly Design (manual, standards-based) ([Serpreme SEO][1])
* HIPAA-Conscious Infrastructure (hosting/email/forms/booking) ([Serpreme SEO][1])
* Custom Plastic Surgery Website Design (premium trust-first UI)
* Consult Conversion Architecture (procedure → proof → consult)
* SEO-Optimized Procedure Content (E‑E‑A‑T aligned)
* Fast, Image-Optimized Development (Core Web Vitals targets) ([Google for Developers][2])

---

### PACKAGES + FAQ

Keep pricing/cards identical unless the business wants changes. Rewrite a few bullets to mention “consult conversion” and “procedure content,” but preserve the structure. ([Serpreme SEO][1])

---

## Notes for the developer (important)

* The new page should be a *PPC-optimized* version of the reference layout: keep the same style, but add the hero form + sticky CTA patterns.
* Don’t add extra navigation friction. If the current page template includes full nav, consider a “reduced nav” variant for ad traffic only (same styling, fewer exits).

---

This PRD is designed so you can paste sections directly into Cursor and have it clone the existing page, swap in the copy, and add conversion mechanics without breaking the SERPreme design system.
